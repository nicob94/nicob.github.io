          The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl
          (Gallus gallus). Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population
          of 23.7 billion as of 2018.
          up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated
          fowl. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less
          commonly, as pets.
          Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the
          Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BC).

        <p>
          Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef
          since prehistoric times. Beef is a source of protein and nutrients.
          Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts, short
          ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.), while
          other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, on the other hand, are usually mixed with
          meat from older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages.
          The blood is used in some varieties called blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten include other muscles and
          offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas
          and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although forbidden where there is a danger of
          bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, commonly referred to as mad cow disease), the kidneys,
          and the tender testicles of the bull (known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky
          Mountain oysters).
          Some intestines are cooked and eaten as is, but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings.
          The bones are used for making beef stock. Meat from younger cows (calves) is called veal.

          Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt,
          accompanying a variety of ingredients, such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables.
          Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to
          as shari, or sumeshi.
          Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or
          short-grain rice.
          It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat.
          Many types of sushi are vegetarian.
          It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan)
          are popular garnishes for the dish.
          Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced
          raw fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.
